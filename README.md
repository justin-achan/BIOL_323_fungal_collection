Boletopsis distribution data
As part of the BIOL 323 2023 Capilano fungal diversity project I collected a specimen of Boletopsis to determine species, I did a morphological study and looked at distribution of B. leucomelaena and B. grisea from Consortium of Pacific Northwest Herbaria and the New York Botanical Garden Steere Herbarium. I also looked at possible associated tree symbionts in genus Pinus, Pseudotsuga, and Picea drawing from GBIF data to look for patterns of distribution between Boletopsis species to aid in the identification of my collected specimen.
